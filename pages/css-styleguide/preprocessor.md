The most supported CSS preprocessor at 18F is Sass/SCSS. Using this pre-processor means you'll get supported resources such as frameworks, libraries, tutorials and a comprehensive styleguide as support.

That being said, any preprocessor is allowed as long as it's a sound project and has community support.

The recommended way to compile your sass code is through [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass) (rather than ruby sass). This allows eliminating the dependency on ruby for projects that don't already require it and is the fastest method of compiling sass.
