# Content Security Policy

## What is Content Security Policy?
Content Security Policy (referred to as **CSP** in the rest of this guide) is a security measure designed to mitigate the likelihood of Cross-Site Scripting (XXS) attacks and data injection.

It can be enabled on either client- or server-side, and is unobtrusive in unsupported browsers â€” that is, browser that don't support CSP will ignore it's directives and load the page as normal.

CSP is supported by the current versions of **all modern desktop browsers**: Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and IE Edge. It is also supported in recent versions iOS Safari and Chrome for Android.

Unfortunately, support for numbered versions of IE is essentially zero, with no support for IE < 10 and only two directives supported in IE 10+.

All of the above supported browsers support CSP 1.0, with 100% support for 2.0 in Webkit/Blink browsers, and partial, but very good, support in Firefox. CSP 2.0 has all the features of 1.0, with several additional directives and support for inline `<script>` and `<style>` tags (see [Caveats](#caveats)).

## Usage
CSP is straigtforward to implement, and supports providing a policy via HTTP header or `<meta>` tag.

#### Policies

The most important aspect of CSP is the policy itself, which is written as a string of **directives**. Directives describe how the browser should treat different content types. They are represented as a `;` delimited key-value pair.

For example, a basic directive to control where your site's `src` (e.g. images, stylesheets, and JavaScript) content must be loaded from is written as `"default-src https://*.federal-site.gov"`

In general, your policy will restrict loading of content to known
sources, and a usable sample policy could look something like this:

`"default-src 'self'; srcipt-src https://facebook.com; child-src https://youtu.be; object-src 'none';"`

Let's break this down:

```
  default-src self : Only load content from the current
    origin, exluding subdomains

  script-src https://facebook.com : Allow
    scripts (e.g. `Like` button code) from Facebook
    to load over HTTPS

  child-src https://youtu.be : Allow embedded content
    from youtube over HTTPS

  object-src none : Prevent flash content from loading
```

A full list of available directives and keywords is outside the scope of this guide, but is available in the excellent Google CSP guide linked in the [Further Reading](#further-reading) section.

It might be useful to test your policies before letting them use on your users. To do this, use the `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` HTTP header. Combined with the reporting information in the next section, you can monitor the kinds of content your user's are encountering and tweak the your policy accordingly.


#### Reporting
CSP can also be configured to send reports to an endpoint you control when content that violates your policies is encountered.

To do this, use the `report-uri` directive, passing it a fully qualified URI e.g. `https://my-public-site.gov/reports/csp`. Now, each time content from an invalid source is encountered, your browser will POST a JSON payload to the provided URI.

Here is an example, from the MDN article linked in [Further Reading](#further-reader)

```
{
  "csp-report": {
    "document-uri": "http://example.com/signup.html",
    "referrer": "",
    "blocked-uri": "http://example.com/css/style.css",
    "violated-directive": "style-src cdn.example.com",
    "original-policy": "default-src 'none'; style-src cdn.example.com; report-uri /_/csp-reports"
  }
}
```

This data can of course be mixed with other request metadata, like IP address or browser User-Agent, and fed into whatever log processing system your app has in place.

Reporting can only be enabled via HTTP header, not inside a `<meta>` tag!



### Client-side Implementation
To implement CSP on the client, add a `<meta>` tag to your web site's `<head>`.

`<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self'; img-src https://*; child-src 'none';">`

You're done!

### Server-side Implementation
Similarly, to include CSP on the server, simply return a `Content-Security-Policy: {my-policy-string}` HTTP header in your web responses.

Although a basic CSP policy is relatively easy to write, you might find it easier to use a server-side library to define your policies declaratively. Two of well-known and actively maintained libraries are [secureheaders](https://github.com/twitter/secureheaders), a **ruby** gem written and maintained by Twitter, and the [helmetjs](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet) middleware for **express.js**.

## Caveats
A major caveat is that CSP, by default, prevents developers from adding inline `<style>` and `<script>` tags, and from specifying JavaScript behavior or CSS `style` attributes directly on DOM elements. This isn't a bad thing, as current best practices in front-end development discourage the use of these patterns.

However, there are scenarios in which you may want to use an inline content tag, such as including a Google Analytics initialization script. For these cases, CSP allows the user to supply a `nonce` attribute to the inline script: `<script nonce=GHDGsfsd83hfdfFD3>...javascript here...</script>`. Then, in your policy, `script-src 'nonce-GHDGsfsd83hfdfFD3'`. Nonces must be regenerated on each request. Additionally, CSP 2.0 allows you to generate a SHA hash of the script content, and pass that to the `srcipt-src` directive as `'sha-{content-sha}'`. You don't need to use a `nonce` attribute if your content is hashed.

Another potential issue is third-party libraries that automatically inject JavaScript and CSS into your HTML. If your project utilizes a library that does this, the only solution is
to use the 'unsafe-inline' value when setting the `script-src` directive; this obviously defeats the purpose of having a CSP for your JavaScript. Therefore, you should perform your own research to determine if the third-party scripts your project relies on are loaded in a manner incompatible with CSP, and what work-arounds may be available.
