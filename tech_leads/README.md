## Responsibilities

Technical leads are selected to improve the technical quality of our projects. 
These qualities cover high-level topics, such as system architectures and 
deployment strategies, frequent tasks like library selection and developer 
work-flow, down to line-level style guides. Best practices may arise from each 
lead's experience, but more often come from aggregating knowledge across 18F 
projects. Leads need to maintain a good sense of what problems are recurring 
across teams and be prepared to ensure solutions propagate.

The leads also serve as point people around engineering-wide issues that arise 
within their domains. These include triaging security issues, ensuring the 
maintenance of shared libraries, pinch-hitting when teams are missing specific 
skills, and the like. Leads therefore need to be generally available to 
address these issues directly or indirectly.

Additionally, technical leads serve as subject matter experts for meta
discussions such as business development and staffing.

While technical leads are ultimately responsible for the quality of the 
resolution, they will most certainly delegate to working groups, individual
developers, etc. as appropriate.

## The Leads API

There are several methods technical leads may offer to help us achieve our 
objectives, and different expectations may be set for each offering. Combined, 
this defines our "Leads API".

### Office hours

Leads may offer dedicated time on a regular basis to act as "office hours". 
During this time, the lead is explicitly available for discussing
architectures, [rubber
duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)-ing solutions, and
other point-to-point conversations. Be aware that if the topic is regarding a
billable project, leads may tock their time against that project. See the "18F
Engineering" calendar to review upcoming sessions.

Leads may be available outside of office hours for similar conversations, but
may also require ad-hoc scheduling.

### Project reviews

Reviewing project-specific practices enables leads to bring to your team their
experience and knowledge of other 18F projects. These reviews can be scoped as
widely (see our [architecture reviews](../architecture_reviews/)) or narrow as
you need, depending on your situation. We strongly encourage you to engage
with technical leads as early as possible, when they can help you avoid or
solve the kinds of problems that will be harder with time. Leads may suggest
developers with more subject matter expertise conduct the review, but in
either case, time spent on project reviews will be tocked to that project.

Technical leads do *not* leverage project reviews as a deployment gate; they 
are non-binding and exist to aid the individual project only, though the leads 
also gain insight into that project's challenges which may recur elsewhere.

### Engineering-wide discussions

When higher-level decision making needs to take place, leads may organize and
invite the whole chapter to discuss. These may be through a video conference
or asynchronously through the #dev Slack channel and surveys. The relevant 
leads will have a course of action to recommend and need your input 
(positive *and* negative), such as whether or not to standardize on a 
particular piece of technology like Docker or a development practice like 
branching vs. forks. Time spent on this dicussion will be billed to "General".

### Guides

Leads, as well as our working groups, may document learnings and best 
practices in developer guides. These can cover a wide range of topics
from recommended libraries, to linter setup, to tooling setup. They may include
warnings about potential pain points and strong recommendations for 
standardization based on past projects. Guides are only guides, not policy
(though they may refer to policy); use them when you don't have a specific 
preference or when you need assistance resolving a technical disagreement.

All of our guides are living documents. Please make suggestions via pull
requests, issues, or the relevant Slack channel.

### Other

Some miscellaneous methods that leads may also offer:

* Leading tutorials, book clubs, and other educational presentations.
* Maintaining specific projects like scaffold generators and gitsecrets
  rules.
* Individual mentoring, code reviews, and other personal feedback (by
  request).

Please note: this Leads API is not set in stone. Your suggestions on how the 
API could be changed to better serve 18F's needs are always welcome!
