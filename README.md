## Front End Guild

18F promotes team best practices across speciality areas through guilds. These guilds support their members in whatever way deemed most appropriate by those members themselves. [This branch](https://github.com/18F/frontend/tree/research) houses guild research into its membership needs.

This repo is where the 18F Front End Guild keeps its guide to best practices and resources for front end development.

## How to track what we're doing, and how you can be involved!

We use issues in this repo to track work.

### How Guild best practices are developed

1. Team members suggest needs in issues, and guild leads identify issues through [research](https://github.com/18F/frontend/tree/research).
2. If resolving these issues requires documentation, a draft document is created in an internal Google Doc that is open to comment and announced to #g-frontend for contribution. NB: You can see all in-process docs in [this internal folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/#folders/0B84F26FpUP0lR1B2VVNGSi1MMVk/0B0C6PKlzps2JV3pqX3NJdm5WejA/0B5HeQa_YQ6-VTTlkVEFNZ2VWZEU/0B2CjDILjK8_jfmp1c2ZJM2d0eEtGSHFEeS1CenlHWEQ0S01jcWJfZXNObElUQV9Yei0wZ2s).
3. Once a relatively clear and stable version emerges, an alert is posted to #dev, #g-frontend and #design for more review and comment.
4. Once comments are resolved, the guide is posted publicly (location dependent on content).
5. The best practice or guide is announced to TTS via #news and email.

### How to edit or suggest changes to an existing guide

The front end space is rapidly changing and all our guides are living documents. Please suggest edits or changes via pull request.
