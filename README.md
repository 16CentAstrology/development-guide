18F Frontend Guide
===================

This is where the 18F Frontend Guild keeps its guide (yep, I went there â€” guild and guide in one sentence) to best practices and resources for frontend development.

The Frontend Guild Roadmap is [the wiki](https://github.com/18F/frontend/wiki), and research into what the guild should be doing to support frontend practice at 18F is kept in [this branch](#).
