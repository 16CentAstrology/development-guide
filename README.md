## 18F Engineering Practices

18F promotes team best practices across specialty areas through guilds. These guilds support their members in whatever way deemed most appropriate by those members themselves.

This repo is where the Engineering Practices Guild keeps its guide to best practices and resources for software development.

## Our mission
We believe that government websites should be functional, maintainable, and thoughtfully designed. Our guild helps TTS promote the adoption and advancement of software development best practices. In this way, TTS can lead by example while providing effective services that help our partners and customers fulfill their missions.
To achieve our vision, the Engineering Practices Guild works to:
- Support the continuous learning necessary for successful software engineering work.
- Provide TTS developers with easy-to-understand, actionable guidance around software engineering best practices.
- Promote a central knowledge base of shared tools and common patterns.
- Create a healthy and supportive internal environment so that we can, in turn, bolster healthy external communities related to our work.
