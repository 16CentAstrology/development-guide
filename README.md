18F Frontend Style Guide
===================

This is where the 18F Frontend Style Guide will live. We do not feel the need to reinvent the wheel, and plan to draw from such guides as those found [here](http://sixrevisions.com/css/css-style-guides/). We do feel, however, that there is benefit from having a guide that the team can work from to make our code easier to maintain and understand across our organization.

More to come soon!
